This campaign makes heavy use of contextual menus (right-click on units or map hexes). In those menus, you'll always find an item showing hints and useful information about objectives and strategy. In some scenarios, you control and recruit units which shall not follow you later. Please read carefully the objectives to learn which ones.
			
I want to thank here all the Wesnoth community and resources authors. Without their contributions, this campaign would not exist.

The first Dark Age was a time of strife and invasion. When Haldric IV died, he left Wesnoth without a king, and the next 70 years were marked by short-lived dynasties, attacks by ever more aggressive orcs, and the further separation of Wesnoth and Elensefar. The Dark Age ended when Garard I took the throne, and began a new dynasty that would last for several hundred years."

	{LSB_DIAL Glynnador _"Boundaries are weaker, and some people can exist in more than one world at the same time. As ghosts or spirits if you prefer. Furthermore, some places are common to different worlds and create bridges, allowing people to move from one to another. At random, I fear..."}
	{LSB_DIAL Tiomen _"But why ?"}
	{LSB_DIAL Glynnador _"I don't know exactly. One could say it's the way things change, but I suspect some power is at work."}

	{LSB_DIAL Glynnador _"Not only that, foolish girl ! Collapsing all realities would create an overpopulated world or banish to nothingness many valuable beings. Most probably a mix of all. Imagine an army of strange creatures claiming suddenly your land is their own and you are intruders ! Imagine you could be doomed to live as an out-of-place spirit in a world you know nothing of !"}

	_"This level is rather tricky because your units will be scattered on different maps. 
You can explore the first map, kill the undead and finally find there is no way to the signpost except for flying units. 
Jani has melded five worlds here and you must make your way through.
The connection beetween worlds are located in villages, not difficult to find, because they don't belong to their normal environment: a village cave in the sands for instance. 
Moving a unit onto one of these villages will teleport it to the next world. 
You can switch from a world to another one using a right-click menu item. 
This way, you can select maps where your units are (if they are all on the same map, the menu has no effect). 
When all your units leave a world, new foes can use the same way to follow you.
You'll find some friends in these worlds. 
You need not to save them and you can leave some behind, but you should take the opportunity to advance some units. 
You will gather here the little army you will need later and only level 2 and higher units will follow.
At the beginning, you need not kill the undead. 
Move to the north and you shall find the first tunnel: a desert village."
