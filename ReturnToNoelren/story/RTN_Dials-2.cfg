     Otherwise, the Janishad influence was growing everyday. Persuasion, corruption or threat, all means were acceptable to their fanatical adepts, and the sect mustered both unquiet souls and the worst scum of the land who found under the honourable guise of religion countless opportunities to perform their ignominious deeds. There were rumors of human sacrifices and dark magics around their temples, but nobody had really the strength or the will to stop them enslaving the country.
     
	 Wesnoth and Noelren were slowly sinking into an endless night."

The king died in the fight, but gave the victory to his army. You are the queen of Noelren."}

This works only if you have produced enough gear. Next, you must move them to the correct training zone (labelled on the map). There, they shall get one experience point each turn, more if an experienced warrior is present (all of them have been moved to their zone at the beginning of the scenario).
To produce gear, you must have some peasants at work in the Forge zone. If Tiomen himself is present, production is doubled.
You can recruit mage apprentices too and train them in their labeled zone (they don't need gear).
Gold can be obtained by plundering carriages passing on the road. The scenario will be shortened if any carriage escort escapes to the border of the map."
